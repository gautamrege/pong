/* Core Logic of Pong */
// 1. Set the position of the play area, paddle, ball and smiley-bricks!
// 2. Ball will keep bouncing off the play area wall i.e. it will reflect off the wall.
// 3. Smiley-bricks are the target - everytime the ball destroys a brick, you get 1 point.
//    * When a smiley-brick is destroyed, it appears again in another location
// 4. Move the paddle to bounce the ball around.
//    * If the ball hits the paddle in the middle, it will reflect exactly!
//    * The more awat from the middle the ball hits the paddel, the larger the angle of relection!
// 5. The game is timed and high scores are maintained for maximum number of smiley-bricks hit.
// 6. Every time 4 points are scored,
//    * The speed of the ball increases by 10%!
//    * The size of the smiley-brick reduces by 10%!
// 7. The ball destroys the smiely-brick and continues it's same trajectory

// Single-player mode:
// 1. Paddle is positioned in the middle and moves horizonaltally only!
// 2. Smiley-bricks are positioned in the top and bottom edges of the play-area

// Two-player-mode:
// 1. Paddles are positioned vertically on the left and right edges of the play area.
// 2. Smiley-brick is positioned in the middle 40% of the play-area
// 3. Player who hits the smiley-brick gets a point.
